## Using ecube examples

### runcli

```
e3 runcli --name pmCli
```
This will create a connector that will be executed on the machine that is running e3. It can be made a part of any playbooks on the playbook engine. Please see this: https://github.com/epiphani-inc/ecube/wiki/Install

## Use ecube to create & run playbooks

### Create a playbook

There are some simple sample playbooks in the gitrepo @ ./samples/playbooks
You will have to edit them to add you AWS secret and key information where it says <>.

Once you have the samples edited and e3 installed, you can just create the playbook like this:
```
e3 playbook create --directory ./samples/playbooks/threeNode --name EC2CL109
```

### Execute a playbook

To execute a playbook you just need to give the name of the playbook to run

```
e3 playbook run --vars '{"region": "us-west-2"}' --name EC2CL108
```

In this case the playbook needs variables - region where it is going to fetch the state from.
